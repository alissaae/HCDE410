    "# Exploring the data.seattle.gov API\n",
    "The API for data.seattle.gov is called the SODA API (for \"Socrata Open Data API\"). This API allows you to do a lot of filtering and selecting your data before you download it. Not all APIs offer this kind of expanded 'query' functionality, but it can be very useful when they do, for at least 2 reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. it is often easier to select and filter the data you want with an API query than by using Python loops and conditional statements.\n",
    "2. it allows you to download only a subset of the dataset. If the dataset is very large this can save space on your computer and speed up your code (because Python doesn't have to loop through so many rows every time you perform an operation).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will walk through a couple of examples of different kinds of API queries you can do with the data.seattle.gov API. If you are interested in getting more practice with this API, you can check out [the API docs here](https://dev.socrata.com/). "
